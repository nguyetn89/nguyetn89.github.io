I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [3D Vision laboratory](https://v3d.openum.ca/) (DIRO, University of Montreal) under the mentoring of [Prof. SÃ©bastien Roy](https://diro.umontreal.ca/repertoire-departement/professeurs/professeur/in/in14484/sg/S%C3%A9bastien%20Roy/). I was a PhD candidate in the [Image Processing laboratory](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~labimage/) under the supervision of [Prof. Jean Meunier](https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/departement-directory/visiting-scholarsadjunct-professors/professor/in/in13785/sg/Jean%20Meunier/) in the same institution. My working projects focus on deep learning and anomaly detection supporting healthcare systems.
