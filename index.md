I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the [Vision](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~labimage/) laboratory at the University of Montreal since September 2015. My PhD program, that is supervised by [Prof. Jean Meunier](http://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~meunier/), is expected to complete in Fall 2019.

Although my project mainly focuses on gait analysis, I am diving into deep learning and its applications on natural data.

My selected publications can be found on the [Publications](/publications.html) page.

Datasets used in my PhD project can be found on the [Datasets](/datasets.html) page.
